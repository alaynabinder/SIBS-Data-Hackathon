Acute myocardial infarction (MI), more commonly known as a heart attack, is a condition that
occurs when one or more areas of the heart muscle does not get enough oxygen. This happens
when blood flow to the heart is abruptly cut off, typically caused by a blockage in one or more of
the coronary arteries. MI results in heart tissue necrosis and is often life-threatening.

Treating and preventing MI is one of the most challenging problems of modern medicine, and it
has been the focus on much medical research over the past 50 years. Acute myocardial infarction
is associated with high mortality in the first year after it. The incidence of MI remains high in all
countries. This is especially true for urban populations of highly developed countries, which are
often exposed to chronic stress factors, irregular and not always balanced nutrition. In the United
States, for example, more than a million people suffer from MI every year, and between 200,000
and 300,000 of them die from acute MI before arriving at the hospital. The disease course in
patients with MI is different. MI can occur without complications or with complications that do
not worsen the long-term prognosis. At the same time, about half of patients in the acute and
subacute periods have complications that lead to worsening of the disease and even death. Even
an experienced specialist cannot always foresee the development of these complications. In this
regard, predicting complications of MI so necessary preventive measures can be carried out in a
timely manner is an important task (Golovenkin, et al; 2020). 

The primary goal is to identify risk factors for one of the following MI complications: atrial
fibrillation, pulmonary edema, or relapse of the MI. Our team focused on relapse of MI.
